abqdata-kml2geojson-transit
===

This node application was written in efforts to make the conversion from KML to GeoJSON easier for the Albuquerque transit data.

The [City of Albuquerque][1] exposes a lot of their data to the public, but, at the time of writing this application, the only format available is KML.
